## Introduction

The present study replicates Experiment 2 from the original research, which assesses whether perceivers use speakers' hierarchy-induced acoustic cues to make hierarchical inferences about speakers. The researchers found that "perceivers used higher pitch, greater loudness, and greater loudness variability to make accurate inferences of speakers' hierarchical rank, demonstrating that acoustic cues are systematically used to detect hierarchy." Of particular interest is the result that "speakers who had been in the high-rank condition — regardless of their sex — were rated as more likely to engage in high-rank behaviors than were those in the low-rank condition."


##Methods

### Power Analysis

Original effect size $\eta^2$ = 0.603, $f^2$ = 0.572. The effect size was determined using the F-statistic and the between- and within-subject degrees of freedom.

$df_1 = 1$

$df_2 = 55$

$F(1, 55) = 83.67$

$\eta^2 = \frac{df_1F}{df_1F + df_2} = 0.603$

$f^2 = \frac{\eta^2}{1 - \eta^2} = 0.572$

Power analysis was done using the software G*Power. To detect an effect size of 0.603, the following samples sizes are needed to achieve various power:
	
Power |Sample Size Needed
------|-------------------
0.8   | 17
0.9   | 21
0.95  | 25

All of these sample sizes are reasonable and financially feasible. Note that in the original research, the sample size used in data analysis actually corresponded to the number of stimuli (speakers) rather than the number of participants in the experiment, since all the scores for each speaker were averaged over all the participants.

### Planned Sample

Forty undergraduates will be randomly selected for the sample, without restriction on age, gender or demographics. This is the same number as in the original study. However, as a result of our power analysis, each participant will listen to only 24 speakers (25 was the necessary sample size calculated, but it must be an even number to ensure equal respresentation between speaker sex), as opposed to 60 which the number of speakers in the original research.

### Materials

Recording of speakers saying aloud the Negotiation Passage: "I'm glad that we are able to meet today and I am looking forward to our negotiation. I know that you and I have different perspectives on some of the key issues and that these differences would need to be resolved for us to come to an agreement."

The following items are used to measure hierarchy-based behavioral influences:

### Procedure

"Each perceiver listened to a subset of recordings of the Negotiation Passage from Experiment 1 (30 female and 30 male voices). After each recording, perceivers rated the speaker on 12 hierarchy-based behaviors plausible in a negotiation context, using a scale from 1 (not at all) to 7  (very much). Six of these behaviors were associated with high rank, and six with low rank. The order of the speakers and the order of the behaviors were randomized for each perceiver. The low-rank behaviors were reverse-scored, and then scores for all 12 behaviors were averaged to create one composite hierarchical-inference score per perceiver per speaker (α = .92). After rating all the speakers, the perceivers listened to the voices a second time, in random order, and judged whether each speaker had been in a high- or low-rank role."

The original procedure is followed exactly, with the exception that Experiment 1 isn't actually carried out - it is just used as a reference in the original research to obtain the recordings of the speakers.

### Analysis Plan
The data will be analyzed with the same approach as in the original research. Effect of condition on hierarchy-based behavioral inferences:

"We examined the extent to which perceivers' hierarchical inferences were consistent with the speakers' hierarchical rank using a 2 (speaker's condition: high rank, low rank) × 2 (speaker's sex: male, female) analysis of variance."

Like in the original research, the current research will look for a main effect of speaker's condition, as well as main effect of speaker sex and interaction effects between speaker condition and sex.

### Differences from Original Study
Apart from the small sample size increase, the only difference between the current study and the original study is the setting. The current study will be entirely online and distributed via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Differences in sample size....

## Pilot Analysis

### Initializtion and Setup

Loading the libaries needed for data analysis.

```{r}
options(warn=-1)

rm(list=ls())
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rjson)
library(tidyjson)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(gridExtra)

sem <- function(x) {sd(x, na.rm=TRUE) / sqrt(length(x))}
ci95 <- function(x) {sem(x) * 1.96}
```

### Data Reading

Data is read from the various json files into a data frame in long form.

```{r}
wid = 1
files = dir(paste0("./","sandbox-results/"), pattern = "*.json")
d.raw = data.frame()
for (f in files) {
  jf = paste0("./", "sandbox-results/",f)
  jd = fromJSON(paste(readLines(jf), collapse=""))
  for (elem in jd$answers$data) {
    id = data.frame(workerId = as.factor(wid),
                      speakerId = elem$speakerId,
                     speakerSex = elem$sex,
                     plev = elem$plev,
                     behaviorScore = elem$behaviorScore)
    d.raw = bind_rows(d.raw, id)
  }
  wid = wid + 1
}
```

### Data Preparation for Analysis

To prepare the data for analysis, speakerSex and plev are recoded with [0, 1] -> [male, female] and [0, 1] -> [low-rank, high-rank], respectively. Two sets of analysis will be carried out:

1. Analysis on the raw data in long form (d.raw)
2. Analysis on the data aggregated by average behavior score, which is what was done in the original research (d.a)

```{r}
d.raw$speakerSex[d.raw$speakerSex == -1] = 0
d.raw$plev[d.raw$plev == -1] = 0

d.a = aggregate(d.raw[2:4], list(d.raw$speakerId), mean)
d.a = rename(d.a, speakerId = Group.1)
```

Now that the data has been prepared, here's a quick look at our data (in both forms) that we will analyze:

```{r}
print(head(d.raw))
print(head(d.a))
```

### Box Plots

We will gather an idea of the distribution of behavior scores in relation to hierarchy condition and speaker sex.

```{r}
boxplot(behaviorScore ~ plev, data = d.raw, xlab="Hierarchy Condition",
        ylab = "Behavior Score", border = c("red", "blue"),
        names = c("Low", "High"), main = "Raw")
boxplot(behaviorScore ~ speakerSex, data = d.raw, xlab="Speaker Sex",
        ylab = "Behavior Score", border = c("red", "blue"),
        names = c("Male", "Female"), main = "Raw")
```

### Geometric Plots

By plotting behavior score against hierarchy condition and sex, we will look for potential main effects and interaction effects that we are interested in testing with our mixed model anova.

```{r}
ggplot(d.raw, aes(x = plev, y = behaviorScore, col = factor(speakerSex, levels = c(0, 1), labels=c("Male", "Female")))) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) + 
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Hierarchy Condition") + 
  ylab("Behavior Score") +
  scale_colour_discrete("Speaker Sex")

ggplot(d.raw, aes(x = plev, y = behaviorScore, col = factor(speakerSex, levels = c(0, 1), labels=c("Male", "Female")))) +
  geom_smooth(method = loess, se = F) + 
  geom_point() + 
  xlab("Hierarchy Condition") + 
  ylab("Behavior Score") +
  scale_colour_discrete("Speaker Sex")
```

### 1. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) - Fixed Effects Model Analysis

Additive Model

```{r}
rs1.1 = aov(behaviorScore ~ plev + speakerSex, data = d.raw)
summary(rs1.1)
```

Interactive Model

```{r}
rs1.2 = aov(behaviorScore ~ plev * speakerSex, data = d.raw)
summary(rs1.2)
```

### 2. ANOVA - Mixed Model Analysis

```{r}
rs2.1 = aov(behaviorScore ~ (plev * speakerSex) + Error(speakerId/speakerSex) + plev, data = d.raw)
summary(rs2.1)

summary(lmer(behaviorScore ~ (plev * speakerSex) + (1 | speakerId), data = d.raw ))
summary(lmer(behaviorScore ~ (plev * speakerSex) + (1 | workerId) + (1 | speakerId), data = d.raw ))
```
