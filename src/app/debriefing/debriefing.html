  <h1>Thank you for participating in this study!</h1>

  <p class="block-text">This study was a replication of the research conducted by Ko et al. in the paper "The Sound of Power - Conveying and Detecting Hierarchical Rank Through Voice", which was published in the 2015 edition of Psychological Science. Of particular interest were the inferences that a listener made about a speaker's hierarchy from the way that speaker talked, and the relationship between these hierarchical inferences and the speaker's hierarchy.</p>
