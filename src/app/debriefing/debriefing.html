  <h1>Thank you for participating in this study!</h1>

  <p class="block-text">This study was a replication experiment 2 of the research conducted by Ko et al. in the paper "The Sound of Power - Conveying and Detecting Hierarchical Rank Through Voice", which was published in the 2015 edition of Psychological Science. Of particular interest were the inferences that a listener makes about a speaker's hierarchy by listening to that speaker talk, and whether these hierarchical inferences are in fact impacted by the speaker's hierarchy.</p>
